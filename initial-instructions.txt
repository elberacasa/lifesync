# LifeSync All-in-One Life Management App Frontend Development Prompt

Create a comprehensive, feature-rich frontend for LifeSync, an all-in-one web application designed to manage every aspect of daily life. Use React for development and Shadcn UI components to ensure a polished, consistent user interface. The app should have a powerful, customizable dashboard reminiscent of financial exchanges, allowing users to view and interact with various life management modules at a glance.

   - Allow users to add, remove, and rearrange widgets for different life management modules
   - Implement a grid layout system for flexible widget placement
   - Include a sidebar for quick navigation between full-page modules

3. Core Modules (each as both dashboard widgets and full pages):
